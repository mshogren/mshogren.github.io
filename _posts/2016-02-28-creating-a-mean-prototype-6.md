This is the sixth part in a series of posts about building a prototype for the ALSL project.  The complete list of posts in the series are

- [Part 1 - Introduction to MEAN prototypes](/2016/02/15/creating-a-mean-prototype-1.html)
- [Part 2 - Creating a prototype using yeoman](/2016/02/18/creating-a-mean-prototype-2.html)
- [Part 3 - Testing the prototype](/2016/02/19/creating-a-mean-prototype-3.html)
- [Part 4 - Building and deploying the prototype](/2016/02/22/creating-a-mean-prototype-4.html)
- [Part 5 - Preparing to extend the prototype](/2016/02/25/creating-a-mean-prototype-5.html)
- [Part 6 - Extending the prototype](/2016/02/28/creating-a-mean-prototype-6.html)

In the previous posts in this series I discussed the some of the reasons for building a prototype, and introduced the [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)).
I covered what I found when I tried to follow [this guide](http://docs.stormpath.com/angularjs/guide/) to build a MEAN prototype that is integrated with the [StormPath](https://stormpath.com) user management service I have decided to use, but there were some tweaks I needed to make along the way, especially in order to get the tests working.
