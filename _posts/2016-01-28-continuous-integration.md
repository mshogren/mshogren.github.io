I wasn't going to blog much about the blog (too meta!) but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get started on something very important to the ALSL project - [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).  In fact what the ALSL project is going to strive for is [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery), but I don't know if we are [ready](https://www.go.cd/2016/01/25/are-you-ready-for-continuous-delivery.html) yet.
